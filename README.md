# VirAnnot

VirAnnot was build to ease the assembly, blast search and taxonomic annotation of metagenomic NGS data. It is used in Virologie team of [UMR1332 BFP](http://www6.bordeaux-aquitaine.inra.fr/bfp) laboratory at INRA.

It is designed to identify viruses in plant metagenomic data but it can be used to assemble and annotate any sequences with the NCBI taxonomy.

NR and NT must be present localy and NCBI taxonomy is loaded in an SQLITE database with provided scripts.
